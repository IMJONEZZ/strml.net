Check out some of my research here:

A lot of my research is based on corpora
and other NLP methods for understanding.

Here's an example.

Here's a link to check out how frequent the word 

teenager 

appears between the years 1810 and 2000

Notice that it isn't even used until the 1940's?

Interesting, right?

What did they call people between the ages of 12 and 20 before that?

Recording and interpreting language change is one of the most
important advances of the time we live in!
